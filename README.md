# Progress Report
Navigating the water of AI
# Week0
In week 0 I was provided some resources to learn through.I learnt about:
1)Numpy
2)Pandas
3)Matplotlib
# Week1
In week 1 I was provided with an assignment which I really loved doing
It was based on how to read data from a .csv file and then operate on it
It had application of the concepts I had learnt in week 0 1.e. Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib
# Week 2
In week 2 I was provided with reading material from which I learnt about supervised learning,unsupervised learning,regression,K means clustering,Random Forest,Data visualisation. This actually was an intro to ML and it took a lot of time but was pretty interesting.
# Week 3
I have completed the week3 videos which contains and explains python's contribution in AI,the videos were pretty long so I completed them in my vacation.
# Week 4
In week 4 , the content was based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), activation functions, gradients, and the importance of Batch Normalization which I felt were very new but still very interesting
# Project
Question Answering (QA) is a field within natural language processing focused on designing systems that can answer questions. Among the more famous question answering systems is Watson, the IBM computer that competed (and won) on Jeopardy!. A question answering system of Watson’s accuracy requires enormous complexity and vast amounts of data, but in this problem, we’ll design a very simple question answering system based on inverse document frequency.

Our question answering system will perform two tasks: document retrieval and passage retrieval. Our system will have access to a corpus of text documents. When presented with a query (a question in English asked by the user), document retrieval will first identify which document(s) are most relevant to the query. Once the top documents are found, the top document(s) will be subdivided into passages (in this case, sentences) so that the most relevant passage to the question can be determined.
