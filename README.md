In week 0 I was provided some resources to learn through.I learnt about:

2)Pandas
3)Matplotlib
# Week1
In week 1 I was provided with an assignment which I really loved doing
It was based on how to read data from a .csv file and then operate on it
It had application of the concepts I had learnt in week 0 1.e. Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib
# Week 2
In week 2 I was provided with reading material from which I learnt about supervised learning,unsupervised learning,regression,K means clustering,Random Forest,Data visualisation. This actually was an intro to ML and it took a lot of time but was pretty interesting.
# Week 3
I have completed the week3 videos which contains and explains python's contribution in AI,the videos were pretty long so I completed them in my vacation.
# Week 4
In week 4 , the content was based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), activation functions, gradients, and the importance of Batch Normalization which I felt were very new but still very interesting
# Project
I am yet to complete the project,I am still working on it.
